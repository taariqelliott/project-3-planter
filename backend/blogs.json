    "description": "Abies koreana 'Aurea' is a golden-yellow form of Korean fir that grows as a broad globe when young and later develops a leader and grows in a broadly upright form. The short needles are bright yellow to golden in color in the spring, becoming dull light green by winter. This is golden foliage is especially attractive when it produces the purple seed cones which are typical of the species. After 10 years of growth, a mature specimen will measure 3 feet (1 m) tall by 1.5 feet (45 cm) wide an annual growth rate of 3 to 6 inches (7.5 - 15 cm).",

    "description": "Extraordinary snake-like, fissured bark, bright green with bluish and silver striping; the bark of this tree will compliment nearby evergreens; lovely mahogany-colored buds all winter, attractive in every season. Snakebark Maple is covered in stunning racemes of yellow flowers along the branches in early spring. It has bluish-green foliage with dark green veins which emerges light green in spring. The serrated lobed leaves turn an outstanding gold in the fall. The smooth bluish-green bark and light green branches are extremely showy and add significant winter interest.",
